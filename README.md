# stethoscope 

Listen to your server with bpftrace. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zmaril/stethoscope.git
cd stethoscope
brew install supercollider 
poetry install 
stethoscope a_server_you_have_in_your_ssh_config # that also has bpftrace installed already
```

And watch as it plays a little tune for you.
